# Speech Recognition and Voice Response App

This project is an interactive speech recognition application that can transcribe spoken Arabic or English audio and respond with text-to-speech (TTS) in Arabic. The app uses several libraries to process and interact with voice input, including SpeechRecognition, Langchain, and Gradio, with Google APIs for enhanced generative AI responses.

## Features:
- **Speech Recognition**: Transcribes spoken language (Arabic or English) into text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
- **Generative AI Response**: The app uses a Google Generative AI model to create meaningful responses based on the recognized text.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts AI-generated responses into spoken output using gTTS or pyttsx3 for Arabic responses.
- **Gradio Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use web interface for voice input and text output.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Google API Key for Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text and Generative AI API
- Libraries:
  - `speech_recognition`
  - `langchain`
  - `langchain_google_genai`
  - `gradio`
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `gTTS`
  
You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup Instructions:

1. **Google API Key**:
   - You will need a Google API key for both the Speech-to-Text and Generative AI APIs. You can obtain one by following the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).
   - Once you have your API key, replace the placeholder `google_api_key` in the code with your actual key.

2. ** Run the Notebook**:
-Open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser.
-Execute the cells in the notebook step by step.
-The notebook will:
    -Record audio using the microphone.
    -Transcribe the spoken words into text.
    -Generate a response using the Google Generative AI model.
    -Use text-to-speech to speak the response.

3. **How It Works**:
   - The app uses a microphone input to record audio.
   - It then transcribes the speech into text (in Arabic or English).
   - Based on the recognized text, the application uses a Google Generative AI model to craft a response in the same language.
   - The response is then spoken back using text-to-speech.

## Example Usage:

1. **Recording Audio**: Click the "Record your voice" button to start recording your voice.
2. **Recognizing Speech**: The app will transcribe the speech into text and display the transcription.
3. **Voice Response**: The app will then use text-to-speech to speak the response generated by the AI model.

## Troubleshooting:
- **Audio Issues**: If the audio isn't recognized properly, try adjusting the microphone sensitivity or re-recording in a quieter environment.
- **API Errors**: Ensure that your Google API key is valid and that the required services are enabled in the Google Cloud console.
